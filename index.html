<div class="div1">hello!!, welcome to the public safty bureau, we asked you to come today to ask  if you would like to join us, the public safty bureau is an organization that deals with getting rid of this nasty society called the sibyl system. the sibyl system will judge you if you have a high crime  coefficient. The Crime Coefficient, which is a number value that represents a person's criminal capacity. This number determines whether an individual requires enforcement by the detectives of the Public Safety Bureau. Detectives are divided into two groups: Enforcers, who are tasked with the investigation of crimes and the apprehension of criminals, and Inspectors, who are charged with managing the Enforcers. For example it starts at zero at first but if you do crimes or your really stressed out your coefficient will start to grow. Also if it gets over a hundred you have to go to a care center and cant leave till it gets better. Then if your coefficient  gets over three hundred you will be exucuted at sight. We want you to join aganist this terrible society and fight aganist the people that believe that the sibyl system is a utopia. The sibyl system is just propaganda, your life may be in constant danger if you join us but thats the risk you will have to take to get a better society. We need more people to help fight with us.
